### Rough question :
You are a wine seller with n number of wine bottle with you. These n bottles have their original prices say, OP[n]={2,3,1,4}.
There are few conditions for selling these wines :
1). Every year we sell exactly one bottle.(i.e. in 1st year-> 1 bottle;2nd year -> 2 bottles....)
2). We only choose either leftmost or rightmost bottle
3). The older the wine, the expensive it is! Keeping that in mind we have the change in price defined as :SP(Selling Price) =OP*i+j(ith year,jth bottle).
Find the max profit the seller can earn .
