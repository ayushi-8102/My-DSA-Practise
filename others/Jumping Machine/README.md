## Problem Statement
Swapnil, being from electronics built a jumping bike. Every second, its jumping power increases by 1 unit. Once a bike starts it has to jump either left or right. Lets imagine racetrack as number line. Bike starts from point 0 on number line. Initial jumping power is 1, so in first jump he can go to +1 or -1 of racetrack (yes racetrack is inifnite length positive & negative). Finish line is located at X point of location. Find minimum number of jumps Swapnil requires to reach to finish line.

Note : You needn't come up with a formal proof of solution.


## Input
First line will contain only one integer X.

-109 ≤ X ≤ 109

## Output
Output minimal number of jumps required to reach to finish line.
